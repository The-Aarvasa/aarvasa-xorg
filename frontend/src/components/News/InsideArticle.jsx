                            Bangalore, India – A new wave of investment is sweeping across India's tier-2 cities, as developers pivot
                            toward mixed-use developments that blend residential, commercial, and recreational spaces.
                            According to a recent report by Cushman & Wakefield, demand for integrated townships in cities like
                            Coimbatore, Indore, and Bhubaneswar has increased by 27% year-over-year.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-10 text-md">
                            Urban planners and real estate experts attribute the trend to a growing population of young
                            professionals and remote workers seeking more balanced lifestyles outside the bustle of metro hubs.
                            The rise of hybrid work models post-pandemic has fueled migration to more affordable cities that offer
                            modern amenities.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="text-2xl mb-10 font-semibold">Why are more people moving to the suburbs?</h2>
                        <p className="mb-10 text-md">
                            "People want more than just a home—they want walkable communities, co-working spaces, cafes, and
                            open green zones," says Priya Arora, Regional Director at Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). "Tier-2 cities are
                            finally catching up with that demand."
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-10 text-md">
                            Several real estate giants have announced major projects this quarter. DLF has committed ₹1,800 crore
                            to a new 110-acre smart township in Kochi, while Godrej Properties is eyeing expansion in Nagpur and
                            Jaipur.

                        <p className="mb-10 text-md">
                            Local governments are also playing a key role. Bhubaneswar's smart city initiative recently launched a
                            public-private partnership (PPP) model offering incentives to developers who prioritize sustainability
                            and affordable housing within these integrated spaces.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-10 text-md">
                            Despite the optimistic outlook, experts warn of the need for cautious development. "Infrastructure
                            must scale with these projects," says Suresh Patel, an urban policy analyst. "Without that, we risk
                            replicating the congestion and chaos of overbuilt metro zones."

                        <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-10 font-semibold">Are housing prices going up or down?</h2>
                        <p className="mb-10 text-md">
                            Still, with property prices in metros stabilizing and a youth-driven market demanding innovation, the
                            boom in tier-2 cities might just be India's next big real estate chapter.
