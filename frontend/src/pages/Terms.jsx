                                fractional ownership through an SPV. In this model: </li><br />
                            <li>(a) You purchase securities in an SPV, such as shares or a partnership interest. </li><br />

                            <li>(d) You must carefully review the specific shareholders' agreement, LLP agreement, and private
                                placement memorandum ("Offer Documents") for that SPV as they will govern all rights, obligations,
                                and terms pertaining to the investment. The Offer Documents take precedence over this Agreement. </li><br />

                            <li>(b) If we suspect any non-compliance with AML regulations, we reserve the right to refuse or
                                suspend your account and to request more information at any time. </li><br />
